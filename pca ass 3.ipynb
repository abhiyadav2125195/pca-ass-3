    " Eigen Decomposition and Significance:\n",
    "Eigen decomposition is the process of breaking down a matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It is significant in linear algebra because it simplifies matrix operations and enables better understanding of the behavior of linear transformations. Diagonalization is one of the key applications of eigen decomposition, where a matrix is represented in a diagonal form, making it easier to compute powers of the matrix and understand its long-term behavior."
